## Invite users

To invite a user, you need their name and email. Note that the email domain must match your organization's format. For example, users that work for Acme (which uses `username@acme.com`) must have `@acme.com` email addresses. They are automatically added to your organization once they accept the invite and complete the sign up.

## Secrets

Manage the secrets that you use for the Remote Network Agent (RNA) and to grant programmatic access to Borealis, such as when you configure the GitHub Action.
