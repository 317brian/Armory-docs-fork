The [**Deployment Status** UI](#deployment-status-ui) provides an overview of all the deployments you have access to and their status at a glance. When you select a deployment, you're shown more granular details, such as when the deployment started and who started it.

The [**Configuration** UI](#configuration-ui) is where you perform actions such as managing users and secrets.
