## Release notes


## Version scheme

Armory LTS releases use the following versioning scheme:

```
year.release-number.patch-number
```

- **`release-number`**: corresponds to what LTS release this is for that particular year. For example, a `release-number` of `2` means that a particular release is the second LTS release of a given year.
- **`patch-number`**: the patch versions that have been released for the LTS release. To get the latest fixes and updates, you want to upgrade to the latest patch number whenever possible.



## Older versions

For information about releases earlier than the LTS releases, see these [Armory Enterprise release notes]({{< ref "rn-armory-spinnaker" >}}).
