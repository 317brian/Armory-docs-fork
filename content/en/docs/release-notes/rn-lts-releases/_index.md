## What is a Long Term Stable (LTS) release?

The initial version of an LTS release (patch `0`) typically includes new features, fixes, and improvements. Subsequent versions of the LTS release focus on fixes as well as stability and performance improvements.

## What does the version number mean?

LTS releases use the following versioning scheme:

```
<year>.<release-number-for-the-year>.<patch-number>
```

For example, 2021.01.3 means that this version is the first LTS release of 2021 and has had 3 patch releases. Patch numbers start at 0 to indicate the initial release of the LTS and increment by one.

## When can I expect a patch release?

Since patch releases focus on fixes and stability improvements, they are delivered as needed. There is no set schedule for them.
