  Develop policies and add them to the Policy Engine to enforce rules on what app developers can and cannot do when using Armory Enterprise.

The Armory Policy Engine is designed to allow enterprises more complete control of their software delivery process by providing them with the hooks necessary to perform more extensive verification of their pipelines and processes in Spinnaker. This policy engine is backed by [Open Policy Agent](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/)(OPA) and uses input style documents to perform validation of pipelines during save time and runtime:

* **Save time validation** - Validate pipelines as they're created/modified. This validation operates on all pipelines using a fail closed model. This means that if you have the Policy Engine enabled but no policies configured, the Policy Engine prevents you from creating or updating any pipeline.
* **Runtime validation** - Validate deployments as a pipeline is executing. This validation only operates on tasks that you have explicitly created policies for. Tasks with no policies are not validated.

For information about how to set up the Policy Engine, see [Enabling the Policy Engine]({{< ref "policy-engine-enable" >}}).
