This section is where the user documentation for your project lives - all the information your users need to understand and successfully use your project. We recommend adding content under the headings in this section, though if some or all of them donâ€™t apply to your project feel free to remove them or add your own. Other content such as marketing material, case studies, and community updates should live in the [About](/about/) and [Community](/community/) pages.
