  What can your user do with your project?
---

Think about your projectâ€™s features and use cases. Use these to choose your tasks. Each granular use case (enable x, configure y) should have a corresponding tasks page or tasks page section. You can give each task a page, or you can group related tasks together in a page, such as tasks related to a particular feature. Users should be able to quickly refer to the Tasks section when they need to find out how to do one specific thing, rather than having to look for the instructions in a bigger tutorial or example.

As well as grouping related tasks in single pages, you can also group task pages in nested folders with an index page as an overview, as seen in our example site.

Each task should give the user

* The prerequisites for this task (this can be specified at the top of a multi-task page if they're the same for all the page's tasks. "All these tasks assume that you understand....and that you have already....")
* What this task accomplishes
* Step by step instructions for the task as a numbered list.
* If appropriate, links to related concept, tutorial, or example pages.
